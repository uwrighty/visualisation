# Summary
This visulisation looks at US domestic flight data from 2003 - 2008. It looks at how the performance of different airlines differs offer time. The data has been aggregated by airline by month to reduce the datasets size. 

#Design 
1. Dataset.
I needed to reduce the size of data file so that it was able to be handled without performance problems in the browser. I wanted the user to be able to judge the performance of their airline compared to others. I also considered including the origin airport in the dataset, but this would have increased the json data file to over 100MB which may have caused problems in the browser.

2. Chart type
I was using a time series, and plotting the average flight performance for a given airline per month, so thought a line graph would work to show the trend, and allow for analysis between different airlines.
